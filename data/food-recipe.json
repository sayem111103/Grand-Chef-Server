Mix with some salt and a pinch of turmeric powder or alternatively saffron powder for color. 3. Now heat oil in a pan. Deep fry the potatoes till brown. Strain the potatoes to remove extra oil and set aside. 4. Now in the same oil add chopped onions, bay leaves, cloves and cook for a minute to make onions tender. No need to fry onions to brown. Add garlic and ginger pastes and stir for a while. Now add cumin powder, red chili powder, cinnamon powder, cardamom powder and some water. Mix and cook well till the spices release oil. Now add meat pieces and mix them properly. No need to add water in this stage since meat releases water. Cook for 5 minutes. 5. When the spices mix gets thick and oil separates, add mace-nutmeg pastes, papaya paste and give a nice mix. Add water and cover with the lid. Cook for 20 minutes. You can add extra water in this stage and cook for extra 5 minutes if the meat is still hard. When water is reduced to half, add turmeric powder and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. 6. Then add water as per your gravy requirement and cook with the lid. While boiling add the potatoes, again close the lid and cook for 15 to 20 minutes. When the gravy is dried to your requirement, turn the heat off and sprinkle some roasted cardamom, cumin and cinnamon powder mix. Serve warm with plain or pulao/pilaf rice, roti, paratha or naan bread.",
